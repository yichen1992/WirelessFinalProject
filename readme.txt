wireless-project.cc is the only program used in the project. A mega-function is written to return throughput as a double variable in the main. The implementation challenge faced is how to do multiple comparisons with a clear organization of the code. Thus, multiple variables are introduced to pass into the function by reference. In this case, functions can be called multiple times in the main area, in this way it will have a clear organizations on the result. 

Throughput is written in a .txt file in case terminal output is lost. the .txt file lists current wifi standard, number of nodes and the resulting throughput.
